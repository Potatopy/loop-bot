# Credits

Since I did take some code from other people, I would like to give them credit so I don't look like a copypasta douche.

- [Glowstik](https://www.youtube.com/@glowstik) - For the music, and economy commands.
- [Civo](https://www.youtube.com/@CivoCode) - Made the welcome system, and the anime commands (the api i found all on my own!)
- [Max Codez](https://www.youtube.com/@maxc0dez) - Made the level system
- [Me!](https://solo.to/wtr) - Formatted all the code into cogs and made the moderation system (most of it).

And all the [contributers](CONTRIBUTING.md) (if there even are any)
